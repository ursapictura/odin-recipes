        <h2>Put those ripe bananas to use in the best banana bread recipe ever. Moist and delicious, it's easy to makeâ€”one bowl, no need for a mixer!</h2>

        <p>This banana bread has been the most popular recipe on Simply Recipes for over 10 years. Thousands of people make it every day. Why?</p>

        <p>Because it really is the best banana bread recipe, period. You can mix everything in one bowl, you can vary the amount of sugar or bananas. And the secret to its great flavor? <strong> butter.</strong></p>

        <p>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs, and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 cup, and many are happy with 1/2 cup.</p>

        <p>You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, or put the batter into muffin tins and make banana nut muffins instead. You can even go a step further and make chocolate banana bread.</p>
